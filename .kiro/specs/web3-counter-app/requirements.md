# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple counter application that demonstrates Web3 integration using Next.js as the frontend framework, Web3.js for blockchain interaction, and deployment on the Polygon testnet. The application will allow users to connect their wallet, view a counter value stored on-chain, and increment the counter through blockchain transactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my MetaMask wallet to the application, so that I can interact with the blockchain counter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a "Connect Wallet" button
2. WHEN the user clicks "Connect Wallet" THEN the system SHALL prompt MetaMask to connect
3. WHEN the wallet is successfully connected THEN the system SHALL display the user's wallet address
4. WHEN the wallet connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. IF no MetaMask is installed THEN the system SHALL display instructions to install MetaMask

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the current counter value from the blockchain, so that I can see the shared state of the counter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL fetch and display the current counter value from the smart contract
2. WHEN the counter value is loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN the counter value fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN the counter value updates THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the displayed value

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to increment the counter by clicking a button, so that I can participate in updating the shared counter state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL display an "Increment Counter" button
2. WHEN the user clicks "Increment Counter" THEN the system SHALL initiate a blockchain transaction
3. WHEN the transaction is pending THEN the system SHALL display transaction status and disable the button
4. WHEN the transaction is confirmed THEN the system SHALL update the displayed counter value
5. WHEN the transaction fails THEN the system SHALL display the error message and re-enable the button
6. WHEN the user has insufficient funds THEN the system SHALL display a specific insufficient funds error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see transaction history and status, so that I can track my interactions with the counter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is initiated THEN the system SHALL display the transaction hash
2. WHEN the transaction is pending THEN the system SHALL show "Transaction Pending" status
3. WHEN the transaction is confirmed THEN the system SHALL show "Transaction Confirmed" status
4. WHEN viewing transaction details THEN the system SHALL provide a link to view the transaction on Polygonscan

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to work specifically with Polygon testnet, so that testing can be done without real cryptocurrency costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL configure Web3.js to connect to Polygon Mumbai testnet
2. WHEN the user's wallet is not on Polygon testnet THEN the system SHALL prompt them to switch networks
3. WHEN network switching is successful THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal functionality
4. WHEN network switching fails THEN the system SHALL display instructions for manual network configuration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive interface, so that I can easily use the application on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern interface
2. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and readability
3. WHEN buttons are clicked THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
4. WHEN the application state changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI accordingly
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
